Plans and Billing
=================

MantisHub offers three plans named Bronze, Silver and Gold.
A 30 day free trial is available for all plans, no credit card required.

Monthly vs Annual
-----------------

Based on popular demand, we now offer annual plans providing the convenience of one bill per year.
The annual plan rate is 11 times the monthly plan with one month free.
Annual plans provide the opportunity to lock today's prices for the next 12 months, but offers no refunds on cancellation.
To switch to annual plan, login to the control panel from mantishub.com, click on drop down on top right, My Account, click on drop down arrow next to Edit, select Change Plan and select the desired plan.
The change will take effect right away and the account will be charged appropriately in the next billing date.

Payment Methods
---------------

MantisHub uses `Paypal <https://www.paypal.com/>`_ and `Stripe <https://stripe.com>`_
for collecting payments.  So pretty much all payment methods they support are
supported.

At this point, we don't support invoicing or payment via checks.

Users won't be charged until their payment trial period expires.

Security of Payment Method
--------------------------

MantisHub only handles the relationship with Paypal or Stripe.  These payment
providers are the ones that store and secure the payment method details.

How to remove payment method?
-----------------------------

An active account must have a valid payment method at any point in time beyond
the trial period.  It is possible possible to change such payment method, but
it is not possible to remove it unless the account is closed.
