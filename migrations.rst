======================
Migrating to MantisHub
======================

What bug trackers can I migrate from?
#####################################

At this point we support migrations from MantisBT.
However, let us know what bug trackers you would like to migration from.

Are there any restrictions on what can be migrated?
###################################################

We don't support the following:

- Code customizations
- Migration from databases other than MySQL.
- Use of deprecated features (e.g. news, project docs, FTP attachments).
- Custom plugins that are not offered by MantisHub.

However, we support config customization, hence, any config overrides you had will work in MantisHub.

What is the process for migration?
##################################

- Signup for a trial using the plan and subdomain name that you would like to migrate to.
- Feel free to try out the MantisHub experience.  Any data entered into the trial will be discarded when your instance is migrated.
- Contact support via our in-app support feature or via our support email.
- Our team will upgrade you to latest MantisBT and then migrate your data to MantisHub.
- Once migrated, you won't have to worry anymore about backups, upgrades, etc.
  You will be able to enjoy the MantisHub experience similar to users who started in MantisHub.
