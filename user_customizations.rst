User Customizations
===================

This section covers features that regular users (rather than administrators) can use
to customize their MantisHub experience.

Setup your avatar
-----------------

MantisHub uses `Gravatar <http://gravatar.com/>`_ to retrieve user avatars based on
a one way hash of their email address. To setup your avatar to show up in MantisHub,
you will have to be registered on `Gravatar <http://gravatar.com/>`_ with the same
email address you use on MantisHub.

Following are the steps to register on gravatar:

- Enter the email address you want to use. Select a password.
- An email will be sent to that email address.  Click the link in the email to confirm and verify.
- Return to the Gravatar website and enter your email address and password.
- Select the image you want to use from hard drive, webcam or internet.
- Crop the image as needed. Preview of a small version and large versions and
  confirm the selection.
- Select the image for the email address. Confirm the choice.
- Go back to MantisHub and the avatar should start showing.

Changing Language
-----------------

MantisHub comes in 50+ languages.  Users can customize their language preference
by going to My Account - Preferences and switching the "language" from default 
language to their preference, and then clicking "Update Prefs".

Customizing columns in View Issues, Csv Export and Excel Export
---------------------------------------------------------------

Users can override that based on their preference via: My Account - Manage Columns.
